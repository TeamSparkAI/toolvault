# ToolVault: AI Agent Tool Management & Security Platform

## Overview

ToolVault is an integrated platform for AI agent tool management and security that provides centralized control, monitoring, and protection for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and their interactions with AI clients. It transforms how organizations deploy, manage, and secure AI tools across their infrastructure.

ToolVault acts as a secure gateway between AI clients (like Claude, Cursor, VS Code) and MCP servers, providing comprehensive visibility, policy enforcement, and threat detection while maintaining the seamless user experience that AI agents require.
