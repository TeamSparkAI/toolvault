ToolVault helps you discover AI agents on your machine, import them, and convert their MCP server usage to managed and secure in one click.

Apply security policies to the traffic flowing between agents and MCP servers to protect your API tokens, secrets, PII, and more.

Manage all of your MCP servers centrally, review message traffic, and monitor policy alerts.
